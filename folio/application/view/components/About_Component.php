            <em>Sparticle</em> is a multi-user online portfolio application. It is built on <em>Laika</em>, a homebrewed bare-bones php framework.</p>             
            <p>
            I built <em>Sparticle</em> because I needed a simple content management system that was tailored to presenting my work online. Many of the current content management systems were either built for specific purposes such as blogging or were too complex and abstracted for use as a simple portfolio management tool.   
            </p>
            <p>
            If you would like to add, modify or otherwise contribute to developing the functionality of this product, both the <em>Laika Framework</em> and <em>Sparticle</em> are licenced under the BSD Lisence and source code is available upon request.
